# Dialysis-Healthcare-Analytics

# Overview
This repository contains multiple dashboards and queries designed to provide insights into dialysis facilities, patient distribution, healthcare outcomes, and financial performance across various states and organizations. The data is analyzed and visualized through tools such as Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and MySQL, offering a comprehensive view of dialysis healthcare metrics.

# Insights:

**Total Dialysis Overview:**
-	There are **15K total facilities** and **133K dialysis stations** across **111 chain organizations.**
-	The system serves **5.88 million patients**, with **595K discharges.**

**Patient Distribution:**
-	The largest group of patients **(1.938M)** fall under **Survival**, while **Fistula** accounts for only **1K patients.** **Transfusion** also has a substantial number of patients **(664K)**, indicating its prominence.

**Dialysis Stations by State:**
-	**California (CA)** has the highest number of dialysis stations (15K), followed by **Texas (TX)** with 9K. Several other states (e.g., GA, NY, IL) show around 5-6K stations.

**Profit vs Non-Profit:**
-	**88.74%** of the dialysis facilities operate under non-profit organizations, while **11.26%** are profit-based, suggesting that the majority of care is provided by non-profit organizations.

**Average Payment Reduction:**
-	The average payment reduction across dialysis services is **0.32%**, which seems relatively low, but this could point toward minimal cost-saving strategies or payment adjustments.

# Recommendations:
**1.	Focus on Patient Outcomes:**
-	High hospitalization and readmission rates could be reduced by improving pre- and post-dialysis care, thereby reducing costs and improving patient outcomes.

**2.	Regional Expansion:**
-	States with fewer dialysis stations (e.g., SC, AZ, WI) may benefit from the expansion of dialysis facilities to meet growing patient demands.

**3.	Monitor Financial Trends:**
-	The **0.32% payment reduction** indicates that further cost-cutting measures or better financial strategies could be explored, especially for for-profit organizations.

**4.	Improve Profit Facility Performance:**
-	With a smaller percentage of for-profit facilities, these organizations could look into better resource optimization and care quality to enhance their market presence.

**5.	Preventive Health Measures:**
-	Considering the number of patients requiring hospitalization, increasing awareness and implementing preventive health measures for dialysis patients could improve survival rates and reduce the strain on healthcare facilities.
